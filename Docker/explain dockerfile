&& Dockerfile = Environment+Dependencies+Source Code
################################
  . FROM: Specifies the base image to use for the Docker image.
    Example: FROM ubuntu:20.04
. ENV: Sets environment variables.
 Example: ENV APP_HOME=/usr/src/app APP_PORT=8080
. LABEL: Adds metadata to the image in the form of key-value pairs.
  Example: LABEL maintainer="you@example.com" version="1.0"
. USER: Sets the user for the subsequent instructions and the CMD instruction.
  Example: USER root
â€¢ ARG: Defines a variable that users can pass at build-time to the builder with the docker build command.
  Example: 
           FROM eclipse-temurin:17-jdk
           ARG JAR_FILE=target/anewtodo*.jar
           COPY ${JAR_FILE} /tmp/app.jar
           COPY target/index.html /tmp/index.html
           ENTRYPOINT ["java","-jar","/tmp/app.jar"]
. WORKDIR: Sets the working directory for subsequent instructions.
  Example: WORKDIR $APP_HOME
. COPY:  Copies files or directories from the host to the container.
  Example: COPY package.json ./ COPY . .
 . ADD:  Copies files from a URL or tar archives and automatically extracts them.
  Example: ADD https://raw.githubusercontent.com/user/repo/branch/file.txt /usr/src/app/file.txt
 . RUN:  Executes a command during the image build process.
  Example: RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y curl git && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*
. VOLUME:  Creates a mount point with the specified path and marks it as holding externally mounted volumes.
  Example: VOLUME ["/data"]
. EXPOSE: Informs Docker that the container listens on the specified network ports at runtime.
  Example: EXPOSE $APP_PORT
 . CMD: Provides the command to run within the container when it starts.
  Example: CMD ["node", "app.js"]
. ENTRYPOINT: Configures a container that will run as an executable.
 Example: ENTRYPOINT ["docker-entrypoint.sh"]
 . HEALTHCHECK: Informs Docker on how to test the container to check that it is still working.
 Example: HEALTHCHECK --interval=30s --timeout=10s --retries=3 CMD curl -f http://localhost:$APP_PORT/ || exit 1
 . STOPSIGNAL: Sets the system call signal that will be sent to the container to exit.
 Example: STOPSIGNAL SIGTERM

CMD ["executable", "param1", "param2"]:

  executable: This is the command or executable that will run inside the container (e.g., node, python, java, etc.).
  param1 and param2: These are arguments passed to the executable.
  Executable: java
  The container will invoke the java command, which is the Java runtime.
  Arguments:
  -jar tells the Java runtime to treat the file at /app.jar as a JAR file and run it.
  /app.jar is the path to the actual application JAR file.
  java -jar command to run the application.
  ###########################CMD VS ENTRYPOINT########################################
  . CMD can easily be overridden when running the container with different commands.
   CMD ["echo", "Hello, World!"]
  docker run myimage echo "Goodbye, World!"
  The container will then execute the command echo "Goodbye, World!" instead of the default echo "Hello, World!"
  
  . The ENTRYPOINT instruction sets the command that will be executed when the container starts, and it cannot be easily overridden by docker run. However, you can pass additional arguments to it when running the container.
   ENTRYPOINT ["echo", "Hello"]
   docker run <image>
   output: Hello
   docker run <image> world
   output: hello world
   docker run <image> Hero
   output: hello hero

&& Best Practices for Docker image creation/Best Practice Writing a Dockerfile 

.  Use specific tags:                   Avoid latest to ensure predictable builds and compatibility.
.  Optimize image size:                 Use minimal base images and multi-stage builds to reduce the image footprint.
                                           ## Mutlistage Dockerfile ###
                                             ###stage1: Build######
                                            FROM schoolofdevops/maven:spring AS build

                                            ####stage2: deploy ####
                                            FROM openjdk:8u201-jre-alpine3.9 AS Runtime

                                            CMD ["java","-jar","petclinic.jar"]
                                        Explaination: 
                                           . stage1:  This stage contains maven build tool which is responsible to generate the Jar File. use are using mvn package command to get the Jar file 
                                           . stage2:   In copy, your copying jar file from build stage to the dest /run dir inside the container 
                                                      . if you observe the stage2 only contains the parent/base image nothing. which only responsible for image size.
                                                      . The result of stage2 will be your dockerimage.
      
                                          
                                        ## Mutlistage Dockerfile ###
                                        # Stage 1: Build
                                        FROM node:14 AS build
                                        WORKDIR /usr/src/app
                                        COPY package*.json ./
                                        RUN npm install
                                        COPY . .
                                        RUN npm run build
                                       # Stage 2: Production
                                        FROM nginx:alpine AS Production 
                                        COPY --from=build /usr/src/app/build /usr/share/nginx/html
                                        EXPOSE 80
                                        CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
                                        Explaination:  In this example, the first stage builds the application, and the second stage uses an Nginx server to serve the built application. 
                                                     . This approach keeps the final image lean and efficient.

.  Exclude unnecessary files:           Use .dockerignore to avoid sending unneeded files in the building the image.
                                        # Ignore Git-related files & log files
                                              .git/
                                              .gitignore
                                              *.log
.  Keep images secure:                  Regularly update base images to include the latest security patches.
.  Scan for vulnerabilities:            Use tools like Trivy or Docker built-in scan before deployment to ensure security compliance.
. Try to avoid RUN apt get update -y or yum update -y in the Dockerfile.
. File which so often change should be written at the end of the file. # example : COPY target/index.html /tmp/index.html

&& To list all files in the directory and display details about myfile.txt, you can use a shell form or exec form in CMD

RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y curl && touch /file2.txt  
    Run instruction in a Dockerfile is used to execute shell commands during the build process of the image.
    You donâ€™t need sudo in a Dockerfile, because commands are typically run as the root user by default in a Docker image.
    RUN command in a Dockerfile creates a new layer in the Docker image. This means that frequent RUN commands can increase the size of your image.
