PROBLEM : Add a user to the linux system and give only the access to a particular file only ?
Answer : 
sudo useradd -m chaitanya           # To add a user chaitanya
sudo passwd chaitanya               # set the password: new@2803NCD for the user
sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config      : set PasswordAuthentication yes
sudo systemctl restart sshd.
sudo groupadd dev                   # create a dev group
getent group dev                    # check if the group was created
sudo usermod -aG dev chaitanya      # Add Chaitanya to the "dev" Group. -aG: Adds the user to the group without removing existing groups.
sudo usermod -g dev chaitanya       #  Add Chaitanya to the "dev" Group. -g: Sets the primary group for the user.
id chaitanya                        # Chaitanya is now part of the dev group, 
groups chaitanya                    # list all the group chaitanya is part of it
sudo chown :dev filelog             # cahnge the group of the user associated with the filelog
sudo groupdel chaitanya             # delete the group created

cat /etc/group
   1.chaitanya:x:1001:
       Group Name: chaitanya
       Group Password: x (default, indicating no password)
       Group ID (GID): 1001
       Members: No members listed (indicating no users are in this group directly)
    2.dev:x:1002:chaitanya
	      Group Name: dev
        Group Password: x
        Group ID (GID): 1002
        Members: chaitanya is a member of the dev group.

ls -la
-rw-r--r--.  1 chaitanya chaitanya    20 Dec  9 07:33  filelog 

-    : directory
rw-  : owner permissions  ( Read (r) = 4, Write (w) = 2, Execute (x) = 1 ) 
-r-  : group permissions  ( Read (r) = 4, Write (w) = 2, Execute (x) = 1 )
r--  : others permissions ( Read (r) = 4, Write (w) = 2, Execute (x) = 1 )

chaitanya:   The owner of the file.
chaitanya:   The group associated with the file.
20:          The size of the file in bytes


sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config     : set PasswordAuthentication yes
                                   : BE CAREFUL WITH PubkeyAuthentication 
                                   : if PubkeyAuthentication is set no, means u cant login with .pem key 


sudo systemctl restart sshd 

ssh chaitanya@ip            
 . chaitanya can only read and write only filelog(which he is owner) cant do anything in the linux System
 . if chaitanya put sudo vi anyfilename , he cant write any file in linux system because he should be the member of sudoers file also.

# Giving chaitanya elevated permissions(superuser)
option 1 : sudo usermod -aG sudo chaitanya
option 2 : sudo visudo
           root   ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL
           ADD Below: 
		       chaitanya ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL
          # ctrl+o:  save the file
		       Enter 
		       ctrl+x: exit from the file.
